# practice-rails-api

This is a folder of scripts that pull from the apis I set up in  my ruby apps that I created in class exercises.

1) product_api works with this ruby app -> https://github.com/twhitelow1/mini_capstone
   To run this script you need to download the ruby app codebase and run on local environment. This script connects to the localhost when the terminal is running
   rails app. Once the rails app is running you can goto the terminal and run the products_api script to pull all the products in the rails app and display in a 
   TTY Table within the terminal
